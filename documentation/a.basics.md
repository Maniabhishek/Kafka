### Kafka ?
> - It is a software platform based of distributed streaming process
> - It is a publish-subscribe messaging system which let exchanging of data between applications, servers, and processors as well.

### What is messaging system?
> - A messaging system is a simple exchange of messages between two or more persons, devices, etc.
> - A publish-subscribe messaging system allows a sender to send/write the message and a receiver to read that message.
> - n Apache Kafka, a sender is known as a producer who publishes messages, and a receiver is known as a consumer who consumes that message by subscribing it.

### What is Streaming process
> - It is the processing of data in parallelly connected systems.
> - This process allows different applications to limit the parallel execution of the data

> - where one record executes without waiting for the output of the previous record. Therefore, a distributed streaming platform enables the user to simplify the task of the streaming process and parallel execution. Therefore, a streaming platform in Kafka has the following key capabilities:
>> - As soon as the streams of records occur, it processes it.
>> - It works similar to an enterprise messaging system where it publishes and subscribes streams of records.

>> - It stores the streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
